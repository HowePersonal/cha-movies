FUZZY SEARCH
We implemented fuzzy search using the edth function, and created a if-else case where it would only apply the fuzzy search when the length of the query was longer than 2. We found that this improved the accuracy of our searches. Then, we unioned the results of the fuzzy search with the results of the fulltext search.
